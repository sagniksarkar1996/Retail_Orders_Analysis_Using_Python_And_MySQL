# End to End Project On Retail Orders Data Using Python and MySQL

### Step 1: Configured Kaggle API and downloaded the `retail orders` dataset from Kaggle website using python

### Step 2: Extracted the downloaded zip file and imported the dataset using `pandas`

### Step 3: Handled missing values and re-configured the column names in the dataset for further optimization using pandas. 

### Step 4: Created new columns like discount, sale price and profit from the data of existing columns like list price, discount percent and cost price. 

### Step 5: Converted the order date column to datetime format using pandas. 

### Step 6: Dropped the columns list price, cost price and discount percent from the dataset due to their insignificance.

### Step 7: Established connection to MySQL using SQL alchemy library and loaded the data to MySQL table. 

### Step 8: Used SQL queries to find out the below mentioned insights from the data: 

#### Step 8.1: Top 10 highest revenue generating products

#### Step 8.2: Top 5 highest selling products in each region

#### Step 8.3: Month over month growth comparison for 2022 and 2023 sales

#### Step 8.4: Exact month denoting the highest sales for each category

#### Step 8.5: Exact sub category which had highest growth by profit percentage in 2023 compared to 2022
